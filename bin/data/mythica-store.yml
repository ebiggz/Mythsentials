##   Item List   ##
#
# Here you can make multiple item.
# Each item can have:
# - a list of item IDs. Each item can have amount, dataID, enchants, name, and lore sections to further customize item!
# - an amount of money (if Vault is installed)
# - an amount of xp levels that will be given
# - worlds that players can claim the item in
# - a list of commands to be run by the console. %player% will be replaced by the players name.
# You can leave out any of these options if you do not wish to use them
# and you can use them in any order

# REMEMBER: Everything is indented 4 spaces from the next line and you can NOT use tabs
